-Thank you.
-Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.
-Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
-This does conclude today's program.
-You may all disconnect, and everyone have a great day.
+I think all of them have very good growth potential this year.
+The video security platform is going to become something very big once we really solve the remaining issues with the network video controller.
+And we are very close to doing that.
+EdgeMAX, the routing platform, has very big potential.
+And I think what you will see is, UniFi is going to evolve into something much larger than just wireless LAN.
-And gross margin -- any thoughts on what gross margin might do?
+And gross margin: any thoughts on what gross margin might do?
-And so last quarter you saw -- last quarter being our Q1 -- you saw the mix of -- UniFi was greatly increased, and airMAX was a lower percentage.
-And then you saw that switched this quarter, with airMAX having a blowout quarter and UniFi being a little bit less, because of the sell-in that I had talked about before.

+Thanks for the explanation, Robert.
+One last follow-up question.
+Outside of UniFi and airMAX, which of the new product platforms, say, 2015s, could emerge as maybe the third major driver of growth?
+Is it EdgeMAX?
+Or the new NanoBeam?
+Or airFiber or airVision?
+Which are the ones that you internally feel most optimistic about?
-Congrats on the results.
+Congratulations on the results.
-On inventory, obviously we have made a major investment on inventory.
+On inventory, obviously, we have made a major investment on inventory.
-The new products that we announced at the airMAX conference -- NanoBeam is shipping now.
-airFiber 5 is going to be shipping very soon.
-And airMAX AP, also very soon.

-So I think last quarter, you saw the effect of getting some of that to their end-customers and putting some inventory on the shelves.

+So no volume discounts, none of the other things that really trip up -- egregious terms on when their payables are due, things like that.
-So it is along the lines of what we are doing today [NUS].
+So it is along the lines of what we are doing today anyways.
-Okay, so UniFi is priced higher than our entry-level UniFi ACs.
-But there is substantial spec differences.
-Our entry-level UniFi ACs are 2.4 gigahertz, 11 and 2 x 2 MIMO radios.
-The UniFi 11ac SKU is dual-radio concurrent, 3 x 3 [gig of the Internet] 8023f power Internet.
-And so it's priced higher.
-And I think the model to compare it to is our UniFi AP-Pro, which I believe might be the biggest contributor in UniFi, from a revenue perspective.
-And that one's doing really well.
-That's priced in the $150 to $200 range.
-So when we priced UniFi AC, we looked at the success of the UniFi AP-Pro, combined with -- we were first to market of enterprise vendors with 11ac products.
-So the pricing, I think, makes sense.
-Right.
-Sorry, my question was -- it's a device [in excess], I absolutely agree with you.
-But the question is, when we see increase or decline, we close the prices at least two times higher, $150 versus $299 or so.
-We need to consider units versus price.
-Meaning, when we see growth in UniFi, we need to understand if it is just because it is the same units that you sold last time.
-But because of the higher price of AC, greater proportion of AC, that is why you are growing?
-Or because, really, units are growing?
-So my question was, can you give us a little bit color of what is happening now when it comes to the breakdown between AC and N?
-What is the growth -- what is the source of the growth?
-Is it more units or more ASP list?
-That was my question.

-I think it is tough to analyze quarter over quarter.
-Because when we introduce new products, we typically have a stocking quarter, followed by, let's say, a deployment quarter.
-And if the product is good, you will see a bump up in later quarters.
-So I think if you look at year over year, what would double or triple.
-So I think my expectation is next year, I want to see double or triple again.
-And to do that, it is going to be an increase in both volumes and ASP.
-But I think all the trends are pointing that we are going to do that.
-And one of the things that is really compelling about UniFi is, we have -- not only do we have a market that nobody is addressing right now.
-But we are actually eating into that other enterprise vendors.
-And there's quite a few examples where some system integrators rip out enterprise Wi-Fi deployments and replace it with ours.
-And it is cheaper to replace the network with ours than it is to pay one year of licensing and support fees to the competitive vendors.
-So I just don't understand how these enterprise vendors keep ripping off customers and charging them tens of thousands of dollars, or hundreds of thousands of dollars, just for support or licensing or hosting fees.
-So I think independent of our UniFi AP pricing, the SKU pricing, you've got to really look at the cost to service and support our networks, which is zero.
-And I think that is the major disrupter as we move forward.
+Right.

+That was my question.
-And maybe if I can take just two more seconds of your time.
-How is the -- just general question about the market.
-How is the take-up rate for the AC?
-Are we there, that customers are demanding AC?
-Or is it still mostly N and AC is in the future?

+And I think that is the major disrupter as we move forward.
-I think right now because of the price points, I think the 11n volumes are going to be dominant until you see the silicon vendors -- such as Broadcom and Qualcomm -- have a second wave of integration, where they reduce the cost of the chip sets to 11n levels.
-When that happens, we will probably have new 11ac APs priced at our current 11n models, and you'll see 11ac take over.
-That is probably going to be -- my guess is second half of 2015.
-And not just us, but probably industry-wide that will happen.
+And maybe if I can take just two more seconds of your time.
+How is the -- just general question about the market.
+How is the take-up rate for the ac?
+Are we there, that customers are demanding ac?
+Or is it still mostly n and ac is in the future?
-Tavis McCourt, Raymond James.

-Craig, a couple for you, and then a follow-up for Robert.
-In the prepared comments, you indicate DSOs should probably start trending back to the low 40s.
-I think you indicated that last quarter as well.
-So I am wondering, is that a longer-term commentary?
-Or should we expect anything dramatic in the near-term?
-And then, the same kind of question with the inventory levels.
-Are those at a place now where we should expect some stabilization, now that this supply chain transition has worked its way through?
-Or is there still more ramp in ending inventory that you would like to do to secure the supply chain?
+Tavis McCourt, Raymond James.
-Okay.
-And then, I wanted to follow up on Robert's comment regarding the commitment to additional R&D, and understand if we should expect this to -- this increase to be funded by growth.
-And can we feel pretty comfortable that operating margins are likely to remain in the mid-35% range, even as you make some of these incremental R&D investments?
+That was actually the worst pronunciation of your last name I have ever heard.
+In terms of the sequential quarter over quarter, we are substantially ahead of where the street had us, in terms of what we were going to do from this quarter to last.
+It just happens that we had a fantastic December and brand.
+I built up the inventory in preparation for the impact that Ubiquiti World Network will have over a period of time.
+Now, does that happen in the next quarter?
+Or is it next couple of quarters?
+Or next three quarters?
+Time will tell, as we are starting to just get in the early analytics of how the campaign has been working.
+But I think that we are very happy with where the growth is right now.
+And I think that we are achieving and exceeding all of our internal targets in terms of where we wanted to be.
-Thank you.
-And our --
+Okay.
+And then, I wanted to follow up on Robert's comment regarding the commitment to additional R&D, and understand if we should expect this to -- this increase to be funded by growth.
+And can we feel pretty comfortable that operating margins are likely to remain in the mid-35% range, even as you make some of these incremental R&D investments?
-Okay, so first on the DSOs.
-Yes, I did say last quarter that we were going to try -- you should expect to creep up.
-And then surprisingly enough, it actually went down.
-So we have done a really good job of managing the channel credit situation.
-And I think we have got everyone lined up like we need them to be.
-Going forward, yes, I don't think 24, 25 -- it's just not sustainable when we have people that are [paid] on net 30 terms.
-So it should creep up.
-It's not going to happen overnight, but it should happen over the next couple of quarters.
-And then on the inventory, if you look at our terms on inventory, it is out of this world how fast we are turning over inventory.
-But I think that we did a substantial build that put us to five weeks of inventory or so.
-And I think that we are going to try to hold it in the five to six weeks going forward.
-So I think we're pretty close to what our target is.
+Craig, a couple for you, and then a follow-up for Robert.
+In the prepared comments, you indicate DSOs should probably start trending back to the low 40s.
+I think you indicated that last quarter, as well.

+Are those at a place now where we should expect some stabilization, now that this supply chain transition has worked its way through?
+Or is there still more ramp in ending inventory that you would like to do to secure the supply chain?
-Got you.
-And then, Robert, the -- it looks like you hired quite a few engineers this quarter, if the prepared remarks were correct.
-I think that 17% increase was sequential quarter to quarter.
-I think that's bigger than you have done in the past.
-And big picture, are these adding to existing product teams?
-Or are you hiring new teams for new product categories?
+Okay, so first on the DSOs.
+Yes, I did say last quarter that we were going to try -- you should expect to creep up.
+And then surprisingly enough, it actually went down.
+So we have done a really good job of managing the channel credit situation.

+So, I think we're pretty close to what our target is.
-It definitely -- it's both.
-And I would say that the first year we went public and I was a public CEO, I really liked -- I was very proud of our financial fundamentals.
-So I looked at -- we had this model of 7 points of OpEx.
-And we had this incredible efficiency I was very proud of.
-So my first year, I really wanted to keep that intact.
-And now that I am seeing the companies that do well in the public markets are ones with much larger visions and growth stories.
-Like an Amazon, for example.
-So I changed my mindset.
-And what I want to go after is hyper-growth without really holding myself to a sub-10-point OpEx model.
-We -- probably in the last year, we've had our most aggressive R&D expansion, and that is going to continue.
-I will say, as far as I know, I am probably the only CEO that does not take cash or equity compensation.
-So these quarter-to-quarter results are nice.
-But I'm in it to build something much bigger.
-So all the decisions I am making on R&D are looking at long-term.
-I think we will continue to aggressively ramp up R&D, both for new initiatives and just really expanding the functions that -- and the power of our enterprise and operator platforms.
+Got you.
+And then, Robert, the -- it looks like you hired quite a few engineers this quarter, if the prepared remarks were correct.
+I think that 17% increase was sequential quarter to quarter.
+I think that's bigger than you have done in the past.
+And big picture, are these adding to existing product teams?
+Or are you hiring new teams for new product categories?
-Right.
-And can you remind me also, in terms of the airMAX upgrade and transition to a base AC chip set on the airMAX platform.
-How impactful do you expect that to be to the service provider business?
-Is this something that we should expect to quickly rip and replace?
-Or just build for new networks?
-Or, go through what you expect to happen when the new generation of airMAX comes out.
+It definitely -- it's both.
+And I would say that the first year we went public and I was a public CEO, I really liked -- I was very proud of our financial fundamentals.

-When we first started designing our airMAX AC platform, I didn't think it would be that impactful in the market.
-The reason being, the special efficiency going from our current airMAX line based on 11n, to airMAX based on 11ac silicone is only about 30%.
-Because we still only can use 2 x 2 MIMO.
-We have few degrees or thought analyses in minus-size with vertical-horizontal polarization of the antenna.
-And so really what we are gaining is a modulation from -- we go from 64 [clam] to 256 clam with 11ac.
-That is only usable in certain conditions with very high signal strength.
-And so I didn't think too much of 11ac -- the move to 11ac when we first started development.
-However, in the past year, there has been some new development.
-So our airMAX AC platform now has a dedicated processor that runs our airMAX protocol.
-And the timers are much more granular.
-And we are seeing huge improvements in multi-point networks.
-So I think airMAX AC will be a game changer.
-We are seeing two to three times performance improvements in our field testing.
-So we are really excited about that.
-In addition, we have a new technology launching with airMAX AC called air prism.
-We talked about that in our airMAX conference show in October.
-That is going to significantly improve the selectivity of our base station radios.
-And they are going to perform significantly better in high-noise environments.
-And as more and more radios get deployed, that becomes increasingly more important.
-So I think I'm very excited about airMAX AC this year.
+Right.
+And can you remind me also, in terms of the airMAX upgrade and transition to a base AC chip set on the airMAX platform.
+How impactful do you expect that to be to the service provider business?
+Is this something that we should expect to quickly rip and replace, or just build for new networks, or go through what you expect to happen when the new generation of airMAX comes out.
-Okay, that's helpful, Robert.
-And one follow-up on the balance sheet.
-The cash is obviously really piling up.
-I suspect most of that is overseas.
-And I am wondering in terms of options to put that cash to use, you have got a bit of a unique model.
-So I suspect acquisitions don't make sense.
-But if you could talk about what the future plans for that cash could be, that would be helpful.
-Thanks.

+And so really what we are gaining is a modulation from -- we go from 64 CLAM to 256 CLAM with 11ac.

-Congratulations.
-A couple questions.
-First, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your backlog and visibility coming into the March period.
-It seems like you have built quite a bit of inventory this quarter.
-But you're guiding for a much slower sequential increase during the March period then we have seen over the last few quarters.
-I was curious to understand to what degree you are being conservative here.
-Or do you expect the March quarter to be a bit of a digestion period for channel inventory?
-Anything that you have seen that has been a change from the last few quarters.
+Jess Lubert, Wells Fargo Securities.
-That was actually the worst pronunciation of your last name I have ever heard.

-I'll answer that.
-So increasing your R&D capability.
-My philosophy is probably different than most companies.
-At Ubiquiti, we don't have recruiting teams, we don't have specific open recs we are looking to fill.
-We don't just believe in adding headcount to R&D to get more productivity.
-We believe -- and we have a very high selectivity for who we bring on.
-And we are always looking for top talent.
-Sometimes we get waves of talent, and sometimes we go through a tough patch.
-So it is unpredictable how much we will add in R&D each month for the next year.
-But I can tell -- I am being as aggressive as possible.
-And most of our growth is probably outside of Silicon Valley, for sure, and outside the US.
+Thank you.
+And our --

-Two questions, if I could.
-First, just looking at the regions here.
-It looks like Latin America had a pretty nice breakout this quarter.
-And it seems like the first one since the issues of a year, year-and-a-half ago.
-So just curious on your take on that important the region, if you think this is the beginning of a trend.
-Or just maybe a little bit of catch-up there.
-And then the second question, on the Ubiquiti World Network.
-Craig, I was a little surprised to see that the SG&A was down in the quarter.
-Am I right to assume that means the legal costs came down more than the initial spend for Ubiquiti World Network?
-And to follow on Jess Lubert's question there, your answer about potential inventory for Ubiquiti World Network.
-Should we take that to assume that you probably have not yet seen any impact of stocking for any demand that would come with the Ubiquiti World Network?
-So there was none of that embedded in the numbers in the December quarter?
-Thanks.
+Tim Long, BMO Capital Markets.
-Okay, so I will start with the -- you've got an echo there (inaudible).

+Okay, so I will start with the -- you've got an echo there (inaudible).
-Some of the Ubiquiti World Network has been (inaudible) we have offsetting us.
-We've got an echo here.
-Okay.
-We have offsetting costs that have a -- against our legal spend that was outsized over the last year.
-And I think the Ubiquiti World Network, we put together a budget.
-We are executing to that.
-And I think it's -- the spend is going to be relatively flat after you knit those two things together.
-With regard to the inventory, yes, the channel did not start ordering inventory anticipation.
-I think they have taken a let's see what happens on our end.
-We did prepare.
-And we've localized some of the inventory across the region so that we actually can respond to demand as it grows.
-And people don't have to deal with longer lead times, so that we can service their end-customers faster.
-And then -- can you remind me of your first question?
-I think we lost him.
+Sorry.
-Danielle, let's move on to the next question.
+Some of the Ubiquiti World Network has been (inaudible) we have offsetting us.
+We've got an echo here.
+Okay.

+And I think the Ubiquiti World Network, we put together a budget.
+We are executing to that.
+And I think it's -- the spend is going to be relatively flat after you net those two things together.
+With regard to the inventory, yes, the channel did not start ordering inventory anticipation.
+I think they have taken a let's see what happens on our end.
+We did prepare.
+And we've localized some of the inventory across the region so that we actually can respond to demand as it grows.
+And people don't have to deal with longer lead times, so that we can service their end-customers faster.
+And then -- can you remind me of your first question?
+I think we lost him.
-Sanjit Singh, Wedbush.
+Danielle, let's move on to the next question.
-Robert, I just want to ask you a conceptual question on service contracts.
-You talked a little bit about that a couple of minutes ago.
-I wanted to get your sense -- as you try and penetrate the enterprise market.
-If you have customers that potentially have unique or difficult deployments, what is Ubiquiti's role in terms of aiding them and helping them with that deployment?
-Is that something that you push to the channel?
-Or is there -- if there's not a service contract in place, what is the enterprise customer's insurance policy for a situation like that?
+Sanjit Singh, Wedbush.
-This is the biggest misconception regarding Ubiquiti.
-People say we do not have support or we don't have great support.
-We do.
-I would say our support is as good, if not better, than any of the competitive enterprise [wild fund] vendors.
-What we don't have is phone support.
-I don't believe in phone calls.
-I never take phone calls.
-I think it is incredibly inefficient.
-So we do everything through e-mail.
-We have a pretty substantial e-mail support team that resolves issues in record times.
-Our internal ratings are very high.
-And then we also have this very rich community that has 1,000-plus posts per day, and hundreds of thousands of numbers that take pride into helping each other out.
-And it is fully transparent, with the very R&D development engineers that are working on the product.
-So I think we have a very high level of support and engagement with the actual design team behind the product of the Company's [all have].
-So I don't know who is spreading this kind of misconception that we don't have support, or our support is inferior.
-Because I do not believe that is the case at all.

-A contractual obligation?
+Is that something that is contractually obligated by Ubiquiti, if there is a question out there from a customer?
+Is there a service-level agreement, where you are able to respond by a certain period of time?
+Or what practices do you have in place for a situation like that?
-Well, like if a customer has a problem with the deployment, and they need someone right away or within 24 hours, is that --
+A contractual obligation?
-I will say this.
-We have an incredible amount of goodwill and participation on our form, despite being a completely transparent Company.
-So we have had a number of issues in the history of the Company, with software, major software bugs, major hardware defects.
-And the fact that we have such a great goodwill within our community and fanatical Ubiquiti users is a testament to how we have taken care of customers over the years.
-So the people that have used Ubiquiti products know us as a Company that gives the customer unbelievable transparency, to the developers behind the products.
-And also a great level of willingness to make things right.
-Whether it is replacing products, whether is fixing bugs quickly.
-And I think our model is the future model.
-We have cut out all the middlemen, which I believe are impedances to delivering value and satisfaction to end-users.
+Well, like if a customer has a problem with the deployment, and they need someone right away or within 24 hours, is that --
-Thanks for the explanation, Robert.
-One last follow-up question.
-Outside of UniFi and airMAX, which of the new product platforms -- say, 2015s -- could emerge as maybe the third major driver of growth?
-Is it EdgeMAX?
-Or the new NanoBeam?
-Or airFiber or airVision?
-Which are the ones that you internally feel most optimistic about?
+I will say this.
